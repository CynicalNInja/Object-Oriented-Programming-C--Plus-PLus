 * {Students will create their own class object. They will 1) create their class interface within
a header file, 2) implement their member functions within a .cpp file, and 3) test their class
within a main file. They will learn about private variables and ways to manipulate them
using mutator functions and access them via accessor functions with respect to scope. Lastly,
students will learn to link their files together.}

 * {Describe 1) what was most challenging and 2) how you solved/overcame the problem OR
 * the directions of how you PLAN to solve it}
